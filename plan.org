* ToDo
 - [ ] Get newer WOA data
 - [ ] Add error bars and change combined.png plot appropriately.
 - [ ] remove filtering on temperature - does not work well at all - see combined_noTfilter.png
 - [ ] plot SD of filtered temperature with depth

* Things that could be improved
 1) I interpolate TAO profile onto standard depth grid - could do without and get inferred mode with greater fidelity

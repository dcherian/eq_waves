* ToDo [2/8]
 - [ ] Get newer WOA data
 - [ ] make sure I can redownload TAO data - reproducibility!
 - [ ] turn scripts to generic functions
 - [ ] generic run script to go with above
 - [ ] Add error bars and change combined.png plot appropriately.
 - [ ] remove filtering on temperature - does not work well at all - see combined_noTfilter.png
 - [X] plot SD of filtered temperature with depth
 - [X] I interpolate TAO profile onto standard depth grid - could do without and get inferred mode with greater fidelity
* Notes
** Sept 14, 2016
- Added butterworth filter.
- Filtering both temperature and dynamic height consistently works for both butterworth and running mean filters
* Meetings
** Next
- [ ] Butterworth v/s running mean filtering
- [ ] Filter window
- [ ] Filtering with gaps in data time series
- [ ] filtering temp also?
- [ ] remove mean before filtering : makes filtered time series a lot better
- [ ] error bars?
- [ ] J Lilly multitaper spectra

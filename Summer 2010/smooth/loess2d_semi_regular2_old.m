%Quadratic loess smoother for data sampled irregularly in 2D.
%   The quadratic loess is a "locally-weighted" least-squares fit
%   to a quadratic surface.  Points are downweighted
%   with distance from the point being estimated.  This implentation 
%   downweights with scaled distance, r,like (1-r^3)^3 and doesn't use
%   any data outside the ellipse defined by the span where r=1.)
%   This version returns NaNs for grid points that are outside 
%   the span of all data points.  The "span" widths specify 
%
%
%[hi,W] = loess2d_semi_regular2(x,t,h,Sx,St,xi,ti,xdim)
%
%  This version is the same as loess2d_semi_regular, except it 
%    exploits reularity in the space dimension instead of the time 
%    dimension for speeding up the computation.
%  -->If your input data has a longer space dimension, use this version.
%
% Inputs:
%   x=  one of the independent variables for samples
%	(must be same size as h)
%   t=  the other independent variable for samples
%	(must be same size as h)
%   Sx= Smoother span for x diminsion (halfpower passband is ~0.6*Sx)
%   St= Smoother span for t diminsion
%   xi= desired grid for x dimension
%   ti= desired grid for t dimension
%   h=  2D matrix of the data corresponding to (x,t)
%   xdim= the dimesion of h that corresponds to the x coordinate (1 or 2)
%
% Outputs:
%   hi= estimates on new grid
%   W (disabled)=  Weight matrix giving the linear combination 
%       of the original data that maps the original data
%       to the gridded data (i.e., W*h=hi)
%

% Plan was to add this, but it seems this could be done by controlling
%  number of data points required for fit.
% New "option" (must edit code):
%   If variable badflag is set to 1, the matrix inversion in the 
%   least-squares fit will be checked.  If the matrix inversion is
